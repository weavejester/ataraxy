# Ataraxy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/weavejester/ataraxy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/weavejester/ataraxy)

A data-driven routing and destructuring library for [Ring][]. This
library is still being developed, so some functionality may change
before we hit version 1.0.0.

[ring]: https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring

## Rationale

There are several data-driven routing libraries for Ring, such as
[bidi][], [Silk][] and [gudu][]. Ataraxy differs from them because
it not only seeks to match a route, it also destructures the
incoming request.

In this sense it is similar to [Compojure][], in that the idea is to
remove extraneous information. However, while Compojure is designed to
use chains of functions, Ataraxy defines its functionality through a
declarative data structure.

## Example

```clojure
{["/api" {uid :identity}]
 {"/products"
   {[:get]                [:products/list uid]
    [:get "/" pid]        [:products/get uid ^uuid pid]
    [:get "/search" #{q}] [:products/search uid q]
    [:post {body :body}]  [:products/new uid body]}}}
```


## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

    [ataraxy "0.4.1"]


## Routing

Ataraxy uses a data structure to tell it how to route and destructure
requests. See the following section on [syntax](#syntax) for details.

```clojure
(def routes '{"/foo" [:foo]})
```

We can match a request map to a result with `matches`:

```clojure
(ataraxy/matches routes {:uri "/foo"})
=> [:foo]
```

If Ataraxy cannot correctly match any route, then an error result from
the `ataraxy.error` namespace is returned. For example:

```clojure
(ataraxy/matches routes {:uri "/bar"})
=> [:ataraxy.error/unmatched-path]
```

See the [errors](#errors) section for more details.

For performance, we can also pre-compile the routing data:

```clojure
(def compiled-routes (ataraxy/compile routes))
```

The resulting object can be used in `matches` in the same way as the
raw data structure:

```clojure
(ataraxy/matches compiled-routes {:uri "/foo"})
=> [:foo]
```


## Handlers

Once we have our routes, it's likely we want to turn them into a Ring
handler function. Ataraxy has a function called `handler` for this
purpose:

```clojure
(defn foo [request]
  {:status 200, :headers {}, :body "Foo"})

(def handler
  (ataraxy/handler
   {:routes   routes
    :handlers {:foo foo}}))
```

This function takes a map with three keys:

* `:routes`     - the routes to match
* `:handlers`   - a map of result keys to Ring handlers
* `:middleware` - a map of metadata keys to Ring middleware (optional)
* `:coercers`   - a map of symbols to coercer functions (optional)

The handler function is chosen by the key of the result. Two keys are
added to the request map passed to the handler:

* `:ataraxy/result` - contains the matched result
* `:route-params`   - a map of parameters matched in the path
                      (included for compatibility)

The handler can also return a result vector instead of a request
map. Each vector that is returned is checked against the handler map,
until eventually a Ring response map is returned.

The `ataraxy.response` namespace defines a number of responses on
the default handler, allowing for code like this:

```clojure
(require '[ataraxy.response :as response])

(defn hello [{[_ name] :ataraxy/result}]
  [::response/ok (str "Hello " name)])

(def handler
  (ataraxy/handler
    {:routes   '{[:get "/hello/" name] [:hello name]}
     :handlers {:hello hello}}))
```

The default handler is set to `ataraxy.handler/default`, but can be
changed by adding a handler to the `:default` key of the handler map.

Middleware is chosen based on the metadata that is applied to the
result or to the containing routing table. For example:

```clojure
(defn wrap-example [handler value]
  (fn [request]
    (let [response (handler request)]
      (assoc-in response [:header "X-Example"] value))))

(def handler
  (ataraxy/handler
   {:routes     {"/foo" ^:example [:foo]}
    :handlers   {:foo foo}
    :middleware {:example #(wrap-example % "test")}}))
```

This would add an `X-Example` header to the response of the
handler. We can also pass an argument to the handler by setting the
`:example` metadata key to something other than `true`:

```clojure
(def handler
  (ataraxy/handler
   {:routes     {"/foo" ^{:example "test"} [:foo]}
    :handlers   {:foo foo}
    :middleware {:example wrap-example}}))
```

Custom coercers can be added to the handler by specifying the
`:coercers` option. This is described in more detail in
the [coercers](#coercers) section.


## Syntax

Ataraxy generates routes from a **routing table**, which is a Clojure
map, or a list of alternating keys and values.

The keys of the table are **routes**, and the data type used defines a
way of matching and destructuring a request.

The values are either **results** or nested tables.

Here's a semi-formal definition of the syntax:

```
table  = {<route result>+} | (<route result>+)
route  = keyword | string | symbol | set | map | [route+]
result = table | [keyword symbol*]
```

### Results

Results are always vectors, beginning with a keyword, followed by zero
or more symbols. For example:

```clojure
[:foo id]
```

Results are paired with routes:

```clojure
{["/foo/" id] [:foo id]}
```

The symbols in the route are passed into the result.

The symbols in the result may be tagged with a type they should be
coerced into. For example:

```clojure
[:foo ^int id]
```

See the [coercers](#coercers) section for more detail.

### Keyword routes

A keyword will match the request method. For example:

```clojure
{:get [:foo]})
```

This route will match any request with the GET method.

### String routes

A string will match the `:path-info` or `:uri` key on the request. For
example:

```clojure
{"/foo" [:foo]
 "/bar" [:bar]}
```

This example will match the URIs "/foo" and "/bar".

### Symbol routes

Like strings, symbols match against the `:path-info` or `:uri` key on
the request. Unlike strings, they match on a regular expression, and
bind the string matched by the regular expression to the symbol.

By default the regex used is `[^/]+`. In other words, any character
except a forward slash. The regex can be changed by adding a `:re` key
to the symbol's metadata. For example:

```clojure
{^{:re #"/d.g"} w [:word w]}
```

This will match URIs like "/dog", "/dig" and "/dug", and add the
matched word to the result.

### Set routes

A set of symbols will match URL-encoded parameters of the same name.
For example:

```clojure
{#{q} [:query q]}
```

This will match any request with `q` as a parameter. For example,
"/search?q=foo".

By default, the parameters must be set for the route to match. If you
want the parameters to be optional, you can prefix them with a "?".

```clojure
{#{?q} [:query ?q]}
```

This works the same as the previous example, except that the route
still matches if `q` is `nil`.

### Map routes

A map will destructure the request. Any destructured symbol must not
be `nil` for the route to match. For example:

```clojure
{{{:keys [user]} :session} [:user user]}
```

This route will match any request map with a `:user` key in the
session.

As with set routes, symbols prefixed with a "?" are considered
optional and may be `nil`.


### Vector routes

A vector combines the behavior of multiple routing rules. For example:

```clojure
{[:get "/foo"] [:foo]}
```

This will match both the request method and the URI.

Strings and symbols will be combined in order, to allow complex paths
to be matched. For example:

```clojure
{[:get "/user/" name "/info"] [:get-user-info name]}
```

This will match URIs like "/user/alice/info" and pass the name "alice"
to the result.

### Nested tables

Nesting routing tables is an alternative way of combining routes.
Instead of a result vector, a map or list may be specified. For
example:

```clojure
{"/foo"
 {"/bar" [:foobar]
  "/baz" [:foobaz]}})
```

This will match the URIs "/foo/bar" and "/foo/baz".

You can also use nesting and vectors together:

```clojure
{["/user/" name]
 {:get [:get-user name]
  :put [:put-user name]}}
```


## Errors

When something goes wrong, Ataraxy returns one of the following error
results:

* `:ataraxy.error/unmatched-path`
* `:ataraxy.error/unmatched-method`
* `:ataraxy.error/missing-params`
* `:ataraxy.error/missing-destruct`
* `:ataraxy.error/failed-coercions`
* `:ataraxy.error/failed-spec`

If you're using the `ataraxy.core/handler` function, these are
automatically converted into appropriate Ring response maps. However,
it's generally worth customizing the error responses to the needs of
your application.


## Coercers

Coercers are functions that turn a string into a custom type. Any
symbol in the result can be tagged with a symbol associated with a
coercer function.

For example, it's common to want to change a parameter from a string
into an int:

```clojure
{[:get "/foo/" id] [:foo ^int id]}
```

The `int` and `uuid` coercers are included by default. We can easily
add our own, however:

```clojure
(defn ->float [s]
  (try (Double/parseDouble s) (catch NumberFormatException _)))

(def compiled-routes
  (ataraxy/compile
   '{[:get "/foo/" id] [:foo ^float id]}
   {'float ->float}))
```

And similarly to handlers:

```clojure
(def handler
  (ataraxy/handler
   {:routes   '{[:get "/foo/" id] [:foo ^float id]}
    :coercers {'float ->float}}))
```


## Specs

Results are validated via the `:ataraxy/result` spec. This is a
multi-spec that dispatches off the key, and can be assigned behavior
through the `result-spec` multimethod.

For example:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.spec.alpha :as s])

(defmethod ataraxy/result-spec ::foo [_]
  (s/cat :key any? :id nat-int?))
```

This ensures that any result with `::foo` as the key must have exactly
two elements, with the second being a natural number.

If a spec fails, then a `:ataraxy.error/failed-spec` result is
returned, which if left alone resolves to a 400 "Bad Request"
response in the handler.
